## Project Structure
This project's structure takes inspiration from the official Godot docs guide on [best practices](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/getting_started/workflow/best_practices/index.html) and from braindeads guide on [how to organize a Godot project](https://www.braindead.bzh/entry/creating-a-game-with-godot-engine-ep-2-project-organization).

Also inspired by [Make Pro 2d Games with Godot](https://github.com/GDquest/make-pro-2d-games-with-godot).
